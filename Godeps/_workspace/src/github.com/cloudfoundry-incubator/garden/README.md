# Backends

Garden provides a platform-neutral API for containerization. Backends implement support for various specific platforms. So far, the list of backends is as follows:

 - [Garden Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux/) - Linux Backend

# Garden API

The canonical API for Garden is defined as a collection of Go interfaces. See the [godoc documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) for details.

For convenience during Garden development, Garden also supports a REST API which may be used to "kick the tyres". The REST API is not supported.

For example, if [Garden Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux) is deployed to `localhost` and configured to listen on port `7777`, the following commands may be used to kick its tyres:
```sh
# list containers (should be empty)
curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers

# create a container
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers \
  -d '{"rootfs":"docker:///busybox"}'

# list containers (should list the handle returned above)
curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers

# spawn a process
#
# curl will choke here as the protocol is hijacked, but...it probably worked.
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:7777/containers/${handle}/processes \
  -d '{"path":"sleep","args":["10"]}'
```

See [REST API examples](doc/garden-api.md) for more.

# Testing

## Pre-requisites

* [git](http://git-scm.com/) (for garden and its dependencies on github)
* [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) (for some dependencies not on github)

Make a directory to contain go code:
```
$ mkdir ~/go
```

Install Go. For example, install [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) and issue:
```
$ gvm install go1.4.1
$ gvm use go1.4.1
```

Make sure that your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` are set. For example:
```
$ export GOPATH=~/go:$GOPATH
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

Get garden and its dependencies:
```
$ go get -t -u github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden
$ go get -t -u ./...
```

Install ginkgo (used to test garden):
```
$ go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
```

Run the tests:
```
$ ginkgo -r
```
